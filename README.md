I'm using a LCD4 cape to display a triangle which will keeping pointing to north.

The magnetometer I'm using is HMC5843. It's an I2C device. It's part of the GY-80 module. You can easily get access to documents about GY-80 on the Internet.

Fortunately, Beaglebone Black already has its driver pre-built in. So I don't need to mess with drivers or device trees, which made things even easier.

I'm using Qt4 for graphic programming. I'm new to Qt.


USAGE


wire up the module and run:

./imu-setup

./newtest -qws
