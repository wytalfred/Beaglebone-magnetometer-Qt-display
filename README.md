I'm using a LCD4 cape to display a triangle which will keeping pointing to north.

The magnetometer I'm using is HMC5843. It's an I2C device.

Fortunately, Beaglebone Black already has its driver pre-built. So all I have to
 do is use it, which is not very difficult.
 
I'm using Qt4 for graphic programming. I'm new to Qt.


USAGE


./imu-setup

./newtest -qws
